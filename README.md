This project is currently just for fun and is currently extremely limited; using a specific layout of spreadsheet for the data to be entered into the jounrals and even a specific resolution of monitor. Because of this I am sorry if you hoped to use it straight as it is in the repo. Nevertheless feel free to adapt the code to work for your setup/software.
